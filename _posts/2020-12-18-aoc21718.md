# Task 22 : [Day 17] Reverse Engineering ReverseELFneering

Let us ssh into the target and see what we've got.

we have 2 binaries here, `file1` is just for the tutorial , we will be looking at `challenge1`

Let us analyse it with `radare2`

We used `aaa` to analyze the binary and we can see the list of functions using `afl` . We find that `sym.main` function is present. So we decompile it

### What is the value of local_ch when its corresponding movl instruction is called (first if multiple)?

`1`

`mov dword [local_ch], 1` instruction moves 1 into the local_ch variable

### What is the value of eax when the imull instruction is called?

`6`

`mov dword [local_8h], 6` moves 6 into local_8h and `imul eax, dword [local_8h]` multiplies previous value of 1 and local_8h (1 x 6)  and stores it into `eax`

### What is the value of local_4h before eax is set to 0?

`6`

`mov dword [local_4h], eax` stores value of eax (6) into local_4h

# Task 23 : [Day 18] Reverse Engineering The Bits of Christmas

I'll use `Remmina` to connect to target using `RDP`

if you do not have it already , you can install it as ,

```python
sudo apt install remmina
```

enter the target ip and then username password provided

Now open the TBFC app, try to enter any password... and unless you somehow guessed the right password you must get this dialog box

Now lets look at what is going behind the scenes in this application.

Fire up the IL Spy app and open the TBFC_APP in it

![/assets/images/posts/aoc21718/Untitled%205.png](/assets/images/posts/aoc21718/Untitled%205.png)

`Crackme` section sticks out of many items in the app

![/assets/images/posts/aoc21718/Untitled%206.png](/assets/images/posts/aoc21718/Untitled%206.png)

We can find the password logic if explore around a bit. I found the password check logic in the MainForm

![/assets/images/posts/aoc21718/Untitled%207.png](/assets/images/posts/aoc21718/Untitled%207.png)

Here we find the value of the flag, also there seems to be a string named `santapassword` let us check that out by double clicking

![/assets/images/posts/aoc21718/Untitled%208.png](/assets/images/posts/aoc21718/Untitled%208.png)

we get a hexadecimal constant which translates to `santapassword321` which infact is our password

nice stuff
